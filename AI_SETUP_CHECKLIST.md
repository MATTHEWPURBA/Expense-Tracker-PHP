## 🔐 Security Notes

### API Key Protection:
✅ Stored in `config.php` (already in `.gitignore`)
✅ Never exposed to frontend/browser
✅ Loaded as environment variable only
✅ Not logged or printed anywhere
✅ Not visible in HTML source

### Best Practices:
1. **Never share your API key publicly**
2. **Don't commit config.php to Git** (already protected)
3. **Rotate key if exposed** (free to generate new one)
4. **Monitor usage** at https://makersuite.google.com
5. **Use environment variables** in production (already implemented)

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Before deploying to production:

1. **Set API key in production config**
   ```php
   // Production config.php
   'gemini_api_key' => getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY') ?: 'AIza...'
   ```

2. **Use environment variables** (recommended)
   ```bash
   # .env file (add to .gitignore)
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
   ```

3. **Test in staging first**
   - Verify all features work
   - Check error handling
   - Monitor API usage

4. **Set up monitoring**
   - Check logs regularly: `logs/error.log`
   - Monitor API quota: https://makersuite.google.com
