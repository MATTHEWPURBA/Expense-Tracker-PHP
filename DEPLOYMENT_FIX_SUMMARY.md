# InfinityFree API Routing Fix - Complete Solution

## ✅ Problem Solved

The 404 errors for `/api/auth/login` on InfinityFree have been fixed using **physical PHP files** that route to the main API router.

## 📦 What Was Changed

### 1. Created Physical API Endpoint Files

Created actual PHP files for API endpoints (works without URL rewriting):

- ✅ `api/auth/login.php` - Login endpoint
- ✅ `api/auth/register.php` - Register endpoint  
- ✅ `api/auth/logout.php` - Logout endpoint
- ✅ `api/health.php` - Health check endpoint

### 2. Updated Frontend to Use `.php` Extension

Modified frontend files to call endpoints with `.php` extension:

- ✅ `views/auth/login.php` - Now calls `/api/auth/login.php`
- ✅ `js/api-client.js` - Automatically adds `.php` extension to endpoints

### 3. Enhanced Router

Updated `Router.php` to handle physical file routing correctly.

### 4. Improved CORS Headers

Enhanced `api.php` with better CORS handling for same-origin requests.

## 🚀 Files to Upload

### Critical Files (Must Upload):

1. **API Endpoint Files:**
   - `api/auth/login.php`
   - `api/auth/register.php`
   - `api/auth/logout.php`
   - `api/health.php`

2. **Updated Core Files:**
   - `src/Router/Router.php`
   - `api.php`
   - `js/api-client.js`
   - `views/auth/login.php`

3. **Directory Structure:**
   ```
   api/
   ├── auth/
   │   ├── login.php
   │   ├── register.php
   │   └── logout.php
   ├── health.php
   ├── index.php
   └── .htaccess (optional)
   ```

### Optional Files:

- `.htaccess` (root) - May not work on InfinityFree
- `api/.htaccess` - For routing without .php extension
- `api/auth/.htaccess` - For routing without .php extension

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

In InfinityFree File Manager:

1. Navigate to `htdocs/`
2. Create `api` directory (if doesn't exist)
3. Create `api/auth` directory (if doesn't exist)

### Step 2: Upload API Files

Upload these files to their exact locations:

```
htdocs/
├── api.php (updated)
├── src/Router/Router.php (updated)
├── js/api-client.js (updated)
├── views/auth/login.php (updated)
└── api/
    ├── auth/
    │   ├── login.php (NEW)
    │   ├── register.php (NEW)
    │   └── logout.php (NEW)
    └── health.php (NEW)
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload

Check that files exist:
- ✅ `api/auth/login.php` exists
- ✅ `api/health.php` exists
- ✅ All files have correct content

### Step 4: Test

1. **Test Health Endpoint:**
   ```
   Visit: https://yoursite.rf.gd/api/health.php
   ```
   Should return: `{"success":true,"data":{"status":"healthy",...}}`

2. **Test Login Page:**
   - Visit login page
   - Enable debug mode
   - Try to login
   - ✅ Should work without 404 or CORS errors

## ✨ How It Works

### Physical File Routing

When you call `/api/auth/login.php`:

1. Browser requests: `https://yoursite.rf.gd/api/auth/login.php`
2. InfinityFree loads: `api/auth/login.php` file
3. File modifies environment and includes: `api.php` (main router)
4. Router processes request with path: `/api/auth/login`
5. Router matches route and executes handler
6. Response returned to browser

### Frontend API Client

The `api-client.js` automatically:
- Adds `.php` extension to all endpoints
- Handles CORS correctly
- Logs all requests for debugging

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] `/api/health.php` returns JSON (not 404)
- [ ] Login page loads without console errors
- [ ] Enable debug mode on login page
- [ ] Try to login - should see API call in Network tab
- [ ] No CORS errors in console
- [ ] No 404 errors in console
- [ ] API response shows success or error (not 404)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 404?

**Check:**
1. ✅ Files uploaded to correct location?
   - `htdocs/api/auth/login.php` must exist
2. ✅ File permissions correct?
   - PHP files should be readable (644 or 755)
3. ✅ Directory structure correct?
   ```
   htdocs/api/auth/login.php ✅
   ```

### Still Getting CORS Errors?

**Check:**
1. ✅ `api.php` has CORS headers?
   - Should be at top of file
2. ✅ Headers sent before output?
3. ✅ Same origin for requests?

### Login Works But Other Endpoints Fail?

**Check:**
1. ✅ All API endpoint files uploaded?
   - Need `api/auth/register.php`
   - Need `api/auth/logout.php`
2. ✅ Frontend using correct endpoints?
   - Should include `.php` extension
3. ✅ API client updated?
   - Should auto-add `.php` extension

## 📝 Notes

- **Physical files approach** works on all hosting providers
- **No dependency on URL rewriting** (`.htaccess` rewrites)
- **Backward compatible** - if URL rewriting works, endpoints without `.php` may still work via `.htaccess`
- **API client** automatically handles `.php` extension, so code doesn't need changes

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

✅ API endpoints return JSON responses (not 404)  
✅ Login page works with debug mode enabled  
✅ Network tab shows successful API calls  
✅ No CORS errors in browser console  
✅ No 404 errors in browser console
