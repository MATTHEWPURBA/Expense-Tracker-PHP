```css
:root {
    --primary: #667eea;     /* 👈 Change main color */
    --secondary: #764ba2;   /* 👈 Change gradient color */
}
```

Try these color schemes:

**Ocean Blue:**
```css
--primary: #4F46E5;
--secondary: #0EA5E9;
```

**Sunset Orange:**
```css
--primary: #F59E0B;
--secondary: #DC2626;
```

**Forest Green:**
```css
--primary: #10B981;
--secondary: #059669;
```

### Add New Category

Edit `index.php`, find `$defaultCategories` array (around line 20):

```php
$defaultCategories = [
    // Existing categories...
    
    // Add your new category:
    ['id' => 'groceries', 'name' => 'Groceries', 'color' => '#16A34A', 'icon' => '🛒'],
];
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't see the page

**Check:**
1. PHP is installed: `php --version`
2. You're in correct directory: `pwd`
3. Server is running: Look for "Development Server started"
4. Using correct URL: `http://localhost:8000`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop any running servers (Ctrl+C)
# Restart with:
php -S localhost:8000
```

---

### Issue: Can't add expenses

**Check:**
1. `data/` folder exists
2. Permissions are correct
3. PHP has write access

**Solution:**
```bash
# Create directory if missing:
mkdir data

# Set permissions:
chmod 755 data
```

---

### Issue: Chart not showing

**Check:**
1. Internet connection (Chart.js loads from CDN)
2. Browser console for errors (press F12)

**Solution:**
```
Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
```
