## 🎓 How It Works

### Processing Flow:

```
1. User selects receipt photo
   ↓
2. JavaScript converts to base64
   ↓
3. POST to /api_ai.php?action=receipt
   ↓
4. AIController validates image
   ↓
5. AIService calls Gemini Vision API
   ↓
6. AI uses OCR to read text
   ↓
7. AI extracts structured data
   ↓
8. Returns JSON with expense details
   ↓
9. JavaScript auto-fills form
   ↓
10. User reviews and submits
```

### AI Magic:
- **OCR:** Reads text from image
- **NLP:** Understands context (what's amount, what's merchant)
- **Classification:** Categorizes based on merchant type
- **Parsing:** Structures data into JSON format
